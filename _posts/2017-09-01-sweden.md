## Chapter 01: Intro
We flew into Stockholm at the end of August, just in time to get the last bit of
summer in. This is our first stop out of three for this trip.

Flying into the city you will get a glimpse of the [Stockholm
Archipelago](http://www.stockholmarchipelago.se/en/) - a collection of 30,000
small islands. Stockholm itself is built on 14 different islands.

Getting from the airport to the city center was super convenient. There's an
[express train](https://www.arlandaexpress.com/) that takes about 20 minutes and
runs roughly every 10 minutes. A one way ticket is 35 USD.

As mentioned, Stockholm is a collection of islands, each with it's own character
and unique vibe. The city has an excellent subway so getting around is quick.
Although we recommend you walk - Stockholm is an incredibly charming city.

## Chapter 02: Coffee

The best thing about Sweden is
[Fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(Sweden)), which basically means
coffee time with pastries. To get your caffeine fix, we recommend these spots:

### [Drop Coffee Roasters](https://www.dropcoffee.com/)

<div class="post__location__info">
  <div class="post__location__address">
    <div>Wollmar Yxkullsgatan 10</div>
    <div>118 50 Stockholm</div>
    <div><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BF4D4EHkAc42" target="_blank">Map</a></div>
  </div>

  <div class="post__location__hours">
    <div>Hours:</div>
    <div>Monday to Friday: 8:30am - 6pm</div>
    <div>Saturday and Sunday: 10am - 6pm</div>
  </div>
</div>

Great spot for a pot of coffee or espresso. All coffee here is roasted a few
miles away. Very hipster vibe - simple decor with a lot of natural light. Not
very busy on weekdays - so a great place to get a few hours of work in.

### [Johan & Nyström](https://johanochnystrom.se/)

<div class="post__location__info">
  <div class="post__location__address">

Just a few blocks from Drop Coffe is Johan & Nyström. Absolutely excellent
coffee, available both as filtered (pour over) or espresso. Huge selection of
pastries and sandwiches. Staff was welcoming and very knowledgable. Courses on
brewing and barista basics are also offered.

## Chapter 03: Shopping
Stockholm is filled with many boutique stores. The focus on simplicity and
minimalism that characterizes Scandinavian design shows through.

## Chapter 04: Neighborhood Character

Located south of the main business area and the old town is
[Södermalm](https://www.visitstockholm.com/guides/guide-to-sofo/). We like
to call this Stockholm's hipster island. Filled with small cafes, restaurants,
funky shops and fashion stores this is an island worth spending some time on.
The cafes mentioned above are both located on Södermalm.

## Chapter 06: Where to Get the Views

Some of the best views of the city can be found along
[Monteliusvägen](https://www.visitstockholm.com/see--do/attractions/monteliusvagen/).
It's a short walking path along a hill that has stunning views city hall, the
old town and the water. We took a picture of the sign so we wouldn't forget what
the street was called.

Here it is on a [map](https://goo.gl/maps/ngbeoKLDFov)

## Chapter 07: Booze History

The [Spirit Museum](https://spritmuseum.se/) we felt was something we had to go
see. Its a relatively small museum - we got there a little less than an hour
before closing. Which worked out really well because we had the entire place to
ourselves.

The most interesting part of the museum was learning about the fascinating
history of alcohol in Sweden - and the governments attempts to curb alcoholism.
Turns out that from the early 1900's up as recently as 1955, Swedes were given a
ration. Each citizen would receive a book and upon purchasing alcohol would get
a stamp. If the stamp book filled up, well, you would have to wait until next
month.

There is also an option to purchase a tasting of traditional Swedish liquors, or
[snaps](https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/snaps-and-glogg/). The price for
the tasting (4 ounces of hooch) is cheaper at the museum than buying the
equivalent at a bar. Just be ready for some weird, strong flavors.

## Chapter 08: The Boat

The [Vasa](https://www.vasamuseet.se/en) was the biggest war ship in history
when it sailed from Stockholm's port in 1628. She held that record for roughly
half an hour - the ship sank after sailing just 1,300 meters (4200 feet).
However, thanks to the Baltic's low salt content and cold waters the boat is
almost perfectly preserved and on display.

Sadly, you cannot walk onto the boat, but an impressive sight none the less.

<div class="image-grid">

Here is a scale replica - it is what researchers believe the Vasa looked like
when she left port.
