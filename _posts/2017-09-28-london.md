# London

First stop of this three country trip (England, France, Italy). It's a combined
work / fun trip. Bit of a whirlwind two days - but here are the highlights.

### [Boxpark, Shoreditch](https://www.boxpark.co.uk/)

My flight touched down at 8am. After a quick nap at the hotel I headed down the
street to Boxpark to grab a bite. It's a pop-up mall built out of shipping
containers. Lots of little boutiques, cafes and food.

This was my first time spending a bit of time in Shoreditch. Reminds me quite a
bit of my neighborhood (Capitol Hill) in Seattle. Peak hipster essentially.

### Street Art

Plenty of interesting street art in and around Shoreditch. Even a few Banksy's.

Had quick coffee break at Paper & Cup. Wish I had a bit more time, because I
would have loved to sit and read a book in this cozy coffeeshop / second hand
bookstore.

### [Dishoom King's Cross](http://www.dishoom.com/)

<div class="post__location__info">

Dishoom brings the tastes of Bombay to London. One of my favorites in London, I
would recommend checking out the Dishoom in Kings Cross. Reservation are only
available for groups of 6 or more - otherwise its first come first serve. The
dinner wait can get pretty long. We waited over an hour.
