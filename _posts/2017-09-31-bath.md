# Bath

After spending an hour looking at [Stonehendge]({% post_url
2017-09-30-stonehendge %}), we continued the drive west towards Bath. A city
from the Roman era, Bath's most famous site is the Roman Baths complex.
Constructed around 60 AD, the baths are still incredibly well preserved. While
you can't go swimming (the water is a pretty vibrant green) the museum offers
great insight into Roman history.

A surprising find in such a historic town - an amazing third wave coffee shop.
Probably the highlight of the trip for me. We challenged the barista to serve us
something unique, and he delivered.

The first drink we were served up was something they called a Lungo, something
in between a filter and espresso coffee. Easy to drink as drip but still has the
aroma and fruity-ness of espresso. That was followed up by an excellent natural washed pour over.
