We took the Eurostar from London over to Paris. Since we bought tickets a few
days before, it was more expensive than flying. But it was convenient - from one
city center to another in just over two hours.

I spent the next few days we spent working working out of cafes. I took a few
breaks to wander the city.. I've never been disoriented before. While beautiful,
everything in Paris is roughly the same height. So it's hard to get your
bearings when the streets wind in unexpected ways. But that's part of the charm
I suppose.

## Streets of Paris

I think the best way to enjoy this city during the day is just to start walking
without direction. You'll find an amazing city full of life in any direction you
go.

## Elevator up 
Desparate for some good views and aerial shots, we took the elevator up [Tour
Montparnasse](https://www.tourmontparnasse56.com/en/). It's the tallest building
in Paris and claims to give you excellent views. We went right around sunset.

But I would advise you skip this. The view is nice, but you can get better, more
interesting shots of the city from other locations. Tons of other tourists and
screaming children was not worth the 30 bucks to get up.

Bought tickets day of. Expected to the line to be a massacre. In October, only
took about 30 minutes, instead of the [infamous long
waits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKEXMQVrA1I) you get during peak
season.

Hannah and I are pretty speedy museum people, so one day was more than enough
for the two of us to walk through all of it. Really impressive collection from
all sorts of cultures.

We had noodles of fun taking pictures of people attempting to take pictures of
the Mona Lisa. Seeing the actual painting is a bit underwhelming - its so
crowded and people are pushing and shoving that you can't really take a moment
to appreciate it.

Would recommend slipping through one of the gates about 15 minutes before
closing. As most people were leaving, we stayed in late and managed to snap a
few photos of an empty park.

The most photographed piece of metal on the planet.

My favorite bar in Paris. This place takes pride in their cocktails. A must
visit.

Over the top tiki bar. Just down the street from the Moulin Rouge. Definitely
get a giant punch bowl and split it with a few friends. Or for the brave,
attempt to drink it all by yourself...

Next door to the previous recommendation. The bar features an impressive
absinthe infused menu. More New Orleans than Paris - but another bar you can't
miss.
