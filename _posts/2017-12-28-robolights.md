# Robolights

Probably the most insane Christmas light display you'll ever see. Local artist
Kenny Irwin Jr. has turned his property into one giant Christmas alien horror
show. Built out of tons of junk, scrap and millions of string lights this is
something worth seeing.

Walking into the art installation is quite a trip. Giant robots pieced together
from scrap metal and trash (one is definitely topped with a Jack Box head),
giant rabbits riding motorcycles, countless skulls and plenty of decorated
toilets.

Admission is free (donations encouraged). Check the website for hours, but I
would recommend coming around the Christmas holidays.
